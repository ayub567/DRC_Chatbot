## Getting Started

There are two ways to install Word GPT Plus: through my free hosting service, or by self-hosting it.

I recommend utilizing my hosting service as it is both user-friendly and requires no installation of additional dependencies. Furthermore, you will have access to the most up-to-date version of Word GPT Plus at all times.

Rest assured that your privacy is protected as all data is saved using localStorage.

However, if you desire faster speeds and possess expertise with Node.js, self-hosting is also an option.

### Service hosted by me

#### localhost

This service is built using Cloudflare Pages, domain name: [https://word.msq.pub](https://word.msq.pub)

**For China users, there maybe some network problems, please use `ping word.msq.pub` to see if you can access the domain.**

**You can add `msq.pub` to your proxy software's rules, or use self-hosted.**

1. Download the add-in `manifest.xml` file and Save it to a directory on your computer, such as `C:\Users\username\Documents\WordGPT`.

  - download: [manifest.xml](https://github.com/Kuingsmile/word-GPT-Plus/blob/master/release/instant-use/manifest.xml)

2. Follow the [Sideload add-in](#sideload-add-in) instructions below to install the add-in.

#### docker

You can also use docker to run the service, first docker pull the image, then run the container.

```bash
docker pull kuingsmile/word-gpt-plus
docker run -d -p 3000:80 kuingsmile/word-gpt-plus
```

You need to modify all `[localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)` in manifest.xml to your server address.

Follow the [Sideload add-in](#sideload-add-in) instructions below to install the add-in.

### Self-hosted

If you want to host the add-in yourself, you will need to clone this repo and install dependencies, then run the project. Need Node.js 16+.

```bash
